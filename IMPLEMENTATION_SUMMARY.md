5. **Risk Management**
   - Conservative $3 margin per trade with 3x leverage
   - Position sizing based on balance and risk tolerance

3. **`calculateSupportResistanceLevels()`** - Calculates S/R using pivot points
4. **`executeBreakoutTrade()`** - Executes trades with proper risk management
5. **`callAIForBreakoutAnalysis()`** - Gets AI confirmation and enhanced targets
6. **`calculateFibonacci()`** - Calculates Fibonacci levels for target setting
7. **`setBreakoutStopLossAndTakeProfit()`** - Sets protective orders

### Trading Logic Flow

1. **Scan** → Monitor 20 popular crypto pairs every 5 minutes
2. **Detect** → Identify support/resistance breakouts using pivot analysis
